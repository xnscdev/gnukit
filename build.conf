[Packages]

# which packages to build
# A list of packages to build. Package names should match a file in the `pkg'
# subdirectory without the file extension. Package names should be separated
# by spaces or tabs, or on another line with an indentation after the newline
# character in order to be properly parsed by the build script. Dependencies
# do not need to be listed, any necessary dependencies will be resolved and
# built automatically.
packages =

# run the test suites
# The test suites for many packages fail on Darwin platforms for unknown
# reasons. To enable them anyway, change the value below to `true'.

# cross compiling to different Darwin platforms.
