This repository contains a set of scripts and configuration files for building
various software targeted for GNU/Linux systems from source on macOS platforms.

See the `build.conf' configuration file to customize the installation
directories, build targets, and packages to install. Packages should be listed
in the `packages' field of the `Packages' section, separated by spaces or
newlines followed by indentation. Each package name should be the file name of
a configuration file in the `pkg' subdirectory, without the file extension.

The `build.sh' script in the root source directory will build and install
all packages requested as well as their dependencies.

Note: several packages available are already bundled by macOS, and they are
just newer or different versions of the bundled software. Unlike other package
managers and utilities, this tool does not rename the programs installed by
these packages.
